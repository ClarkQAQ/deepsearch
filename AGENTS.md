# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.

## Build, Run, Test

```bash
# Build
go build -o ./deepsearch -trimpath .

# Run (loads .env by default)
go run . server -d .env

# Verify after any code change
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...

# Regenerate .env.example from pkg/env.Env
go generate ./...

# Build the image from source (multi-stage)
docker build -t deepsearch:local .

# Run the stack with Compose (mounts ./.env at /app/.env)
docker compose up -d
```

Never consider work complete until `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` pass cleanly.

## Container and CI

The `Dockerfile` builds from source in two stages: `golang:1.27-alpine` compiles a static binary, and `alpine:3.24` runs it as the unprivileged `deepsearch` user with `ca-certificates`, `Asia/Shanghai` time, the `scripts/healthcheck.sh` probe, and `/app/.env` as the default config path. Every dependency is public, so the build needs no credentials.

`BUILD_VERSION` / `BUILD_COMMIT` / `BUILD_DATE` are the image build args; `BUILD_VERSION` is injected as `-X deepsearch/pkg/util.version`, which `util.BuildVersion()` prefers over the VCS revision. Keep `.dockerignore` in sync when adding files: `.env` must never enter the build context, and `*.md` must never be excluded globally because `pkg/agentutil/prompt/*.md` is embedded with `go:embed`.

Two workflows live in `.github/workflows`: `ci.yml` runs gofmt, the `.env.example` drift check (`go generate` + `git diff`), `go mod verify`, build, vet and `go test -race`, plus a build-only container job; `container.yml` publishes `linux/amd64` images to `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY,,}` on `v*` tags with semver/`latest` tags, provenance and SBOM. Image names must stay lowercase, and neither workflow needs repository secrets.

## High-Level Architecture

deepsearch is a small Go (1.27) service that exposes web search over a REST API and an MCP server. It is a trimmed port of the cmua search stack: the Anthropic server-side `web_search` tool runs through the `fantasy` agent framework, and `WebFetch`/`GetTime` are the agent's client tools.

- `main.go` — calls `cmd.Execute()`
- `cmd/` — cobra CLI: `root` (with no subcommand it redirects to `server`), `server` (assembles providers, runs the HTTP server, graceful shutdown)
- `internal/service/search/` — domain logic: `Search` (one agent run per request) and `Fetch` (one public page per call)
- `internal/transport/` — registers middleware and routes (`/healthz`, `/v1/search`, `/v1/fetch`, `/mcp`) on the shared echo server
- `internal/provider/` — DI wiring: `SetupEnv → SetupLogger → SetupLLM → SetupSearch → SetupHttp`
- `pkg/agentutil/` — the WebSearch agent (`agents`), its tools (`tools`), and embedded system prompts (`prompt`)
- `pkg/di`, `pkg/env`, `pkg/httperr`, `pkg/slogtrap`, `pkg/util` — reusable infrastructure

Dependencies point inward: `cmd` → `internal/provider` → `internal/service` → `pkg/*`. `internal/transport` depends only on `internal/service` (through the small `transport.Searcher` interface, which also serves as the test seam).

### HTTP Server

The echo instance is owned by `provider.Http` (`internal/provider/http.go`) and built with `echo.NewWithConfig`: the slog logger, `HTTPErrorHandler`, multipart memory limit, and `echo.LegacyIPExtractor`. `StartConfig.BeforeServeFunc` applies `READ_TIMEOUT` / `WRITE_TIMEOUT` / `IDLE_TIMEOUT` / `MAX_HEADER_BYTES` to the `http.Server` and pins `BaseContext` to the app context.

`transport.SetupHttp(ctx)` resolves `provider.Env`, `*search.Service` and `provider.Http` from the container, installs the middleware chain (`Recover → RequestID → RequestLogger`) and calls `register`, which mounts the routes. `cmd.httpRunner` then serves it with `httpServer.StartConfig.Start(ctx, httpServer)`. Tests call the same `useMiddleware` + `register` helpers on a fresh echo instance with the error handler from `pkg/httperr`, so the production chain is covered without a network listener.

Keep `WRITE_TIMEOUT` longer than the slowest realistic search; async/streaming responses are intentionally not supported.

## Dependency Injection

`pkg/di` is a context-based container:

```go
di.Provide(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) (Service, error) { ... })
di.MustInvoke[Service](ctx)
di.Invoke[*Service](ctx)
di.WithCleanup(func(ctx context.Context, s Service) error { ... })
```

Every provider lives in `internal/provider` and is registered by `provider.Setup`. The container keys services by Go type, so `*search.Service` and `*transport.Server` are resolved by pointer type.

## Configuration

`pkg/env.Env` is the authoritative configuration shape; `.env.example` is generated from it by `envdoc` (`go:generate` in `pkg/env/env.go`). Never hand-edit `.env.example`; change `Env` and run `go generate ./...`.

When loaded from a `.env` file the variables carry no prefix; when read from the process environment they require the `APP_` prefix (`provider.EnvConfPrefix`).

## Agent Framework

- The agent is built once per process (`search.New`) and reused; only the prompt changes per request.
- The model is lazily created and cached per model ID in `provider.LLM` (`xsync.Map`), and shared by every request.
- The Anthropic `web_search` tool is a provider-defined server tool: register it with `fantasy.WithProviderDefinedTools(anthropic.WebSearchTool(...))`. It never runs in this process; results come back as `fantasy.SourceContent`, which is how `/v1/search` builds its `sources` list.
- `WEB_SEARCH_MAX_USES` maps to the tool's `max_uses`; `MODEL_OUTPUT_LIMIT` maps to `fantasy.WithMaxOutputTokens`.

### Adding a tool to the search agent

1. Implement `fantasy.AgentTool` in `pkg/agentutil/tools/` (follow `webfetch.go` / `gettime.go`).
2. Register it in `webSearchTools` in `pkg/agentutil/agents/websearch.go`.
3. If it needs configuration, extend `pkg/env.Env`, the `WebSearchConfig`, and `provider.SetupSearch`.
4. Tell the model when to use it in `pkg/agentutil/prompt/websearch_agent_system_prompt.md`.

## HTTP Conventions

- Handlers stay thin: bind input, call the service, map errors. Business logic belongs in `internal/service`.
- Handlers return `*httperr.Error` (`pkg/httperr`) for failures; `httperr.Handler` (wired as the echo `HTTPErrorHandler`) renders the uniform `{"error":{"code","message"}}` envelope, hides internal error text unless `STD_LOG_LEVEL=debug`, turns panics/missing routes into the same shape, and logs every 5xx.
- The service exposes sentinel errors (`search.ErrEmptyQuery`, `ErrInvalidURL`, `ErrFetchFailed`, `ErrFetchDisabled`); the transport maps them to status codes with `errors.Is`.
- `/healthz` is always open; every other endpoint shares the optional bearer-token guard.

## MCP Server

The MCP endpoint is built in `internal/transport/mcp.go` with `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`:

- Tools are added with the generic `sdkmcp.AddTool[In, Out]`; input and output schemas are inferred from struct tags (`json`, `jsonschema`).
- The tool output type is the same `search.Result` the REST API returns, so both surfaces stay in sync.
- The handler returns an error for failed searches, which the SDK packs into a tool error (`isError`) instead of a protocol error.
- Streamable HTTP runs stateless with JSON responses; localhost DNS-rebinding protection is disabled because the default bind address is `0.0.0.0:8231` and the service may sit behind a reverse proxy — access control is the bearer token's job.

## Security Rules for WebFetch

`WebFetch` and `/v1/fetch` must never reach the local network: literal IPs, `localhost`, private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, multicast, reserved, documentation, benchmark and NAT64 ranges are rejected before the request and again at dial time (DNS rebinding), and every redirect hop is re-validated. Keep `pkg/agentutil/tools/webfetch_test.go` green when touching this code.
